        Upload to url_prefix from pg_cluster_dir

        This function ignores the directory pg_xlog, which contains WAL
        files and are not generally part of a base backup.

        Note that this is also lzo compresses the files: thus, the number
        of pooled processes involves doing a full sequential scan of the
        uncompressed Postgres heap file that is pipelined into lzo. Once
        lzo is completely finished (necessary to have access to the file
        size) the file is sent to S3 or WABS.

        TODO: Investigate an optimization to decouple the compression and
        upload steps to make sure that the most efficient possible use of
        pipelining of network and disk resources occurs.  Right now it
        possible to bounce back and forth between bottlenecking on reading
        from the database block device and subsequently the S3/WABS sending
        steps should the processes be at the same stage of the upload
        pipeline: this can have a very negative impact on being able to
        make full use of system resources.

        Furthermore, it desirable to overflowing the page cache: having
        separate tunables for number of simultanious compression jobs
        (which occupy /tmp space and page cache) and number of uploads
        (which affect upload throughput) would help.
