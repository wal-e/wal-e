"""
Converting a file tree into partitioned, space-controlled TAR files.

This module attempts to address the following problems:

* Storing individual small files can be very time consuming because of
  per-file overhead.

* It is desirable to maintain UNIX metadata on a file, and that's not
  always possible without boxing the file in another format, such as
  TAR.

* Because multiple connections can allow for better throughput,
  partitioned TAR files can be parallelized for download while being
  pipelined for extraction and decompression, all to the same base
  tree.

* Ensuring that partitions are of a predictable size: the size to be
  added is bounded, as sizes must be passed up-front.  It is assumed
  that if the dataset is "hot" that supplementary write-ahead-logs
  should exist to bring the data to a consistent state.

* Representation of empty directories and symbolic links.

* Avoiding volumes with "too many" individual members to avoid
  consuming too much memory with metadata.

The *approximate* maximum size of a volume is tunable.  If any archive
members are too large, a TarMemberTooBig exception is raised: in this
case, it is necessary to raise the partition size.  The volume size
does *not* include Tar metadata overhead, and this is why one cannot
rely on an exact maximum (without More Programming).

Why not GNU Tar with its multi-volume functionality: it's relatively
difficult to limit the size of an archive member (a problem for fast
growing files that are also being WAL-logged), and GNU Tar uses
interactive prompts to ask for the right tar file to continue the next
extraction.  This coupling between tarfiles makes the extraction
process considerably more complicated.
